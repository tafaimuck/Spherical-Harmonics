# Spherical-Harmonics

The ultimate goal of this project is to generate data for randomized integer
values of l & ml, and values of θ, & ϕ that range from 0 - 2π. And then fit
the data to the spherical harmonic function to determine the quantum numbers
from simulated data. Additionally I plan to plot the wavefunction and the
probability density for l = 0 to l = 3, and all possible values of ml for those
values of l, since |ml| ≤ l. I chose this project because the quantum numbers l of
the spherical harmonics when graphed into a probability density should relate
to the shape of the orbital and the ml should refer to its orientation in space. A
good example of this is the d0 (with quantum numbers l = 2 & ml = 0) orbital
probability density shown in the figure 1. I hope to better be able to better
relate the quantum numbers to actual atomic orbitals
